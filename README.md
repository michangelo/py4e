# Python for Everybody (PY4E) | Notes and Coding Exercises

Michael Cox | Codecraft Works & Northrop Grumman | August 2023

**All notes and exercises originated from Dr. Charles Severance (Dr. Chuck) and his website [PY4E](https://www.py4e.com/).**

**I am not claiming any of this content as my own. I am simply using it for personal/educational purposes (although the Python exercises are mostly my own solutions).**

For lecture style notes, I simply followed along and copy/pasted the content into this repo for my own personal use and for practice with Git and GitHub. I also wanted to practice using Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks as notetaking methods, as well as practice using the command line and Llinux.
