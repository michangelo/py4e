You can write programs for many reasons, ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping someone else solve a problem. This book assumes that everyone needs to know how to program, and that once you know how to program you will figure out what you want to do with your newfound skills.\n",

    "While this book is not intended for professional programmers, professional programming can be a very rewarding job both financially and personally. Building useful, elegant, and clever programs for others to use is a very creative activity. Your computer or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) usually contains many different programs from many different groups of programmers, each competing for your attention and interest. They try their best to meet your needs and give you a great user experience in the process. In some situations, when you choose a piece of software, the programmers are directly compensated because of your choice.\n",

    "The high-level definitions of these parts are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Central Processing Unit (or CPU)** is the part of the computer that is built to be obsessed with \"what is next?\" If your computer is rated at 3.0 Gigahertz, it means that the CPU will ask \"What next?\" three billion times per second. You are going to have to learn how to talk fast to keep up with the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Main Memory** is used to store information that the CPU needs in a hurry. The main memory is nearly as fast as the CPU. But the information stored in the main memory vanishes when the computer is turned off.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Secondary Memory** is also used to store information, but it is much slower than the main memory. The advantage of the secondary memory is that it can store information even when there is no power to the computer. Examples of secondary memory are disk drives or flash memory (typically found in USB sticks and portable music players).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Input and Output Devices** are simply our screen, keyboard, mouse, microphone, speaker, touchpad, etc. They are all of the ways we interact with the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "These days, most computers also have a **Network Connection** to retrieve information over a network. We can think of the network as a very slow place to store and retrieve data that might not always be \"up\". So in a sense, the network is a slower and at times unreliable form of **Secondary Memory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "While most of the detail of how these components work is best left to computer builders, it helps to have some terminology so we can talk about these different parts as we write our programs.\n",

As a programmer you will mostly be \"talking\" to the CPU and telling it what to do next. Sometimes you will tell the CPU to use the main memory, secondary memory, network, or the input/output devices."

In the end you will be a programmer - perhaps not a professional programmer, but at least you will have the skills to look at a data/information analysis problem and develop a program to solve the problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "Second, you need to **\"tell a story\"**. In writing a story, you combine words and sentences to convey an idea to the reader. There is a skill and art in constructing the story, and skill in story writing is improved by doing some writing and getting some feedback. In programming, our program is the \"story\" and the problem you are trying to solve is the \"idea\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you learn one programming language such as Python, you will find it much easier to learn a second programming language such as JavaScript or C++. The new programming language has very different vocabulary and grammar but the problem-solving skills will be the same across all programming languages.\n",

    "You will learn the \"vocabulary\" and \"sentences\" of Python pretty quickly. It will take longer for you to be able to write a coherent program to solve a brand-new problem. We teach programming much like we teach writing. We start reading and explaining programs, then we write simple programs, and then we write increasingly complex programs over time. At some point you \"get your muse\" and see the patterns on your own and can see more naturally how to take a problem and write a program that solves that problem. And once you get to that point, programming becomes a very pleasant and creative process.\n",

    "Unlike human languages, the Python vocabulary is actually pretty small. We call this \"vocabulary\" the \"reserved words\". These are words that have very special meaning to Python. When Python sees these words in a Python program, they have one and only one meaning to Python. Later as you write programs you will make up your own words that have meaning to you called variables. You will have great latitude in choosing your names for your variables, but you cannot use any of Python's reserved words as a name for a variable.\n",

    "When we train a dog, we use special words like \"sit\", \"stay\", and \"fetch\". When you talk to a dog and don't use any of the reserved words, they just look at you with a quizzical look on their face until you say a reserved word. For example, if you say, \"I wish more people would walk to improve their overall health\", what most dogs likely hear is, \"blah blah blah walk blah blah blah blah.\" That is because \"walk\" is a reserved word in dog language. Many might suggest that the language between humans and cats has no reserved words^[http://xkcd.com/231/].\n",

    "There is little to be gained by arguing with Python. It is just a tool. It has no emotions and it is happy and ready to serve you whenever you need it. Its error messages sound harsh, but they are just Python's call for help. It has looked at what you typed, and it simply cannot understand what you have entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is much more like a dog, loving you unconditionally, having a few key words that it understands, looking you with a sweet look on its face (>>>), and waiting for you to say something it understands. When Python says \"SyntaxError: invalid syntax\", it is simply wagging its tail and saying, \"You seemed to say something but I just don't understand what you meant, but please keep talking to me (>>>).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As your programs become increasingly sophisticated, you will encounter three general types of errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors: These are the first errors you will make and the easiest to fix. A syntax error means that you have violated the \"grammar\" rules of Python. Python does its best to point right at the line and character where it noticed it was confused. The only tricky bit of syntax errors is that sometimes the mistake that needs fixing is actually earlier in the program than where Python noticed it was confused. So the line and character that Python indicates in a syntax error may just be a starting point for your investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic errors: A logic error is when your program has good syntax but there is a mistake in the order of the statements or perhaps a mistake in how the statements relate to one another. A good example of a logic error might be, \"take a drink from your water bottle, put it in your backpack, walk to the library, and then put the top back on the bottle.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic errors: A semantic error is when your description of the steps to take is syntactically perfect and in the right order, but there is simply a mistake in the program. The program is perfectly correct but it does not do what you intended for it to do. A simple example would be if you were giving a person directions to a restaurant and said, \"...when you reach the intersection with the gas station, turn left and go one mile and the restaurant is a red building on your left.\" Your friend is very late and calls you to tell you that they are on a farm and walking around behind a barn, with no sign of a restaurant. Then you say \"did you turn left or right at the gas station?\" and they say, \"I followed your directions perfectly, I have them written down, it says turn left and go one mile at the gas station.\" Then you say, \"I am very sorry, because while my instructions were syntactically correct, they sadly contained a small but undetected semantic error.\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Again in all three types of errors, Python is merely trying its hardest to do exactly what you have asked."

    "When Python spits out an error or even when it gives you a result that is different from what you had intended, then begins the hunt for the cause of the error. Debugging is the process of finding the cause of the error in your code. When you are debugging a program, and especially if you are working on a hard bug, there are four things to try:\n",
    "\n",
    "**reading**: Examine your code, read it back to yourself, and check that it says what you meant to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "**running**: Experiment by making changes and running different versions. Often if you display the right thing at the right place in the program, the problem becomes obvious, but sometimes you have to spend some time to build scaffolding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ruminating**: Take some time to think! What kind of error is it: syntax, runtime, semantic? What information can you get from the error messages, or from the output of the program? What kind of error could cause the problem you're seeing? What did you change last, before the problem appeared?\n",
    "\n",
    "**retreating8*: At some point, the best thing to do is back off, undoing recent changes, until you get back to a program that works and that you understand. Then you can start rebuilding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning programmers sometimes get stuck on one of these activities and forget the others. Finding a hard bug requires reading, running, ruminating, and sometimes retreating. If you get stuck on one of these activities, try the others. Each activity comes with its own failure mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, reading your code might help if the problem is a typographical error, but not if the problem is a conceptual misunderstanding. If you don't understand what your program does, you can read it 100 times and never see the error, because the error is in your head.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running experiments can help, especially if you run small, simple tests. But if you run experiments without thinking or reading your code, you might fall into a pattern I call \"random walk programming\", which is the process of making random changes until the program does the right thing. Needless to say, random walk programming can take a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to take time to think. Debugging is like an experimental science. You should have at least one hypothesis about what the problem is. If there are two or more possibilities, try to think of a test that would eliminate one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a break helps with the thinking. So does talking. If you explain the problem to someone else (or even to yourself), you will sometimes find the answer before you finish asking the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even the best debugging techniques will fail if there are too many errors, or if the code you are trying to fix is too big and complicated. Sometimes the best option is to retreat, simplifying the program until you get to something that works and that you understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning programmers are often reluctant to retreat because they can't stand to delete a line of code (even if it's wrong). If it makes you feel better, copy your program into another file before you start stripping it down. Then you can paste the pieces back in a little bit at a time."

When you were learning to speak, it was not a problem for your first few years that you just made cute gurgling noises.

    "We want you to learn Python much more rapidly, so we teach it all at the same time over the next few chapters. But it is like learning a new language that takes time to absorb and understand before it feels natural. That leads to some confusion as we visit and revisit topics to try to get you to see the big picture while we are defining the tiny fragments that make up that big picture. While the book is written linearly, and if you are taking a course it will progress in a linear fashion, don't hesitate to be very nonlinear in how you approach the material. Look forwards and backwards and read with a light touch. By skimming more advanced material without fully understanding the details, you can get a better understanding of the \"why?\" of programming. By reviewing previous material and even redoing earlier exercises, you will realize that you actually learned a lot of material even if the material you are currently staring at seems a bit impenetrable.\n",

    "If something seems particularly hard, there is usually no value in staying up all night and staring at it. Take a break, take a nap, have a snack, explain what you are having a problem with to someone (or perhaps your dog), and then come back to it with fresh eyes. I assure you that once you learn the programming concepts in the book you will look back and see that it was all really easy and elegant and it simply took you a bit of time to absorb it."
