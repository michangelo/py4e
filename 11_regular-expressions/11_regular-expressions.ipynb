    "So far we have been reading through files, looking for patterns and extracting various bits of lines that we find interesting. We have been using string methods like `split` and `find` and using lists and string slicing to extract portions of the lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task of searching and extracting is so common that Python has a very powerful module called **regular expressions** that handles many of these tasks quite elegantly. The reason we have not introduced regular expressions earlier in the book is because while they are very powerful, they are a little complicated and their syntax takes some getting used to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are almost their own little programming language for searching and parsing strings. As a matter of fact, entire books have been written on the topic of regular expressions. In this chapter, we will only cover the basics of regular expressions. For more detail on regular expressions, see:\n",

So if you have a Macintosh or Linux system, you can try the following commands in your command-line window.\n",

    "This tells `grep` to show you lines that start with the string \"From:\" in the file mbox-short.txt. If you experiment with the grep command a bit and read the documentation for `grep`, you will find some subtle differences between the regular expression support in Python and the regular expression support in `grep`. As an example, `grep` does not support the non-blank character `\\S` so you will need to use the slightly more complex set notation `[^ ]`, which simply means match a character that is anything other than a space."
