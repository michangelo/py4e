    "Execution always begins at the first statement of the program. Statements are executed one at a time, in order from top to bottom.\n",

    "Function *definitions* do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that statements inside the function are not executed until the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function call is like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the body of the function, executes all the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When you call a fruitful function, you almost always want to do something with the result; for example, you might assign it to a variable or use it as part of an expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "x = math.cos(radians)\n",
    "golden = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call a function in interactive mode, Python displays the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    ">>> math.sqrt(5)\n",
    "2.23606797749979\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But in a script, if you call a fruitful function and do not store the result of the function in a variable, the return value vanishes into the mist!\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "math.sqrt(5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This script computes the square root of 5, but since it doesn't store the result in a variable or display the result, it is not very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Void functions might display something on the screen or have some other effect, but they don't have a return value. If you try to assign the result to a variable, you get a special value called `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    ">>> result = print_twice('Bing')\n",
    "Bing\n",
    "Bing\n",

    "```py\n",
    ">>> print(type(None))\n",
    "<class 'NoneType'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

Within the function, the parameters `a` and `b` were 3 and 5 respectively. The function computed the sum of the two numbers and placed it in the local function variable named `added`. Then it used the `return` statement to send the computed value back to the calling code as the function result, which was assigned to the variable x and printed out.\n"

    "## Why Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "It may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into functions. There are several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read, understand, and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the rest of the book, often we will use a function definition to explain a concept. Part of the skill of creating and using functions is to have a function properly capture an idea such as \"find the smallest value in a list of values\". Later we will show you code that finds the smallest in a list of values and we will present it to you as a function named `min` which takes a list of values as its argument and returns the smallest value in the list."

    "\n",
    "Tabs and spaces are usually invisible, which makes them hard to debug, so try to find an editor that manages indentation for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, don't forget to save your program before you run it. Some development environments do this automatically, but some don't. In that case, the program you are looking at in the text editor is not the same as the program you are running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging can take a long time if you keep running the same incorrect program over and over!\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that the code you are looking at is the code you are running. If you're not sure, put something like `print(\"hello\")` at the beginning of the program and run it again. If you don't see `hello`, you're not running the right program!\n"
