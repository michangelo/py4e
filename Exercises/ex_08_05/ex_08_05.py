    1. Open the file mbox-short.txt and read it line by line. 
    2. When you find a line that starts with 'From ' like the following line:
        `From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008`
    3. Parse the From line using split()
    4. Print out the second word in the line (entire address of person who sent msg)
    5. Print the count at the end
    Hint: Make sure not to include the lines that start with "From:".
          Look at last line of sample output to see how to print the count:
          `There were 27 lines in the file with From as the first word`
