    "## The `while` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly. Because iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "One form of iteration in Python is the `while` statement. Here is a simple program that counts down from five and then says \"Blastoff!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "n = 5\n",
    "while n > 0:\n",
    "    print(n)\n",
    "    n = n - 1\n",
    "print('Blastoff!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can almost read the `while` statement as if it were English. It means, \"While n is greater than 0, display the value of `n` and then reduce the value of `n` by 1. When you get to 0, exit the while statement and display the word `Blastoff`!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, here is the flow of execution for a `while` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate the condition, yielding `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the condition is false, exit the `while` statement and continue execution at the next statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the condition is true, execute the body and then go back to step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of flow is called a **loop** because the third step loops back around to the top. We call each time we execute the body of the loop an **iteration**. For the above loop, we would say, \"It had five iterations\", which means that the body of the loop was executed five times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that eventually the condition becomes false and the loop terminates. We call the variable that changes each time the loop executes and controls when the loop finishes the **iteration variable**.

    "## Infinite Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "An endless source of amusement for programmers is the observation that the directions on shampoo, \"Lather, rinse, repeat,\" are an infinite loop because there is no *iteration variable* telling you how many times to execute the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of `countdown`, we can prove that the loop terminates because we know that the value of n is finite, and we can see that the value of `n` gets smaller each time through the loop, so eventually we have to get to 0. Other times a loop is obviously infinite because it has no iteration variable at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you don't know it's time to end a loop until you get half way through the body. In that case you can write an infinite loop on purpose and then use the `break` statement to jump out of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop is obviously an infinite loop because the logical expression on the `while` statement is simply the logical constant `True`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "n = 10\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    print(n, end=' ')\n",
    "    n = n - 1\n",
    "print('Done!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you make the mistake and run this code, you will learn quickly how to stop a runaway Python process on your system or find where the power-off button is on your computer. This program will run forever or until your battery runs out because the logical expression at the top of the loop is always true by virtue of the fact that the expression is the constant value `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is a dysfunctional infinite loop, we can still use this pattern to build useful loops as long as we carefully add code to the body of the loop to explicitly exit the loop using `break` when we have reached the exit condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you want to take input from the user until they type `done`. You could write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    line = input('> ')\n",
    "    if line == 'done':\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(line)\n",
    "print('Done!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop condition is `True`, which is always true, so the loop runs repeatedly until it hits the break statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time through, it prompts the user with an angle bracket. If the user types `done`, the `break` statement exits the loop. Otherwise the program echoes whatever the user types and goes back to the top of the loop. Here's a sample run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "> hello there\n",
    "hello there\n",
    "> finished\n",
    "finished\n",
    "> done\n",
    "Done!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This way of writing `while` loops is common because you can check the condition anywhere in the loop (not just at the top) and you can express the stop condition affirmatively (\"stop when this happens\") rather than negatively (\"keep going until that happens.\")."

    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want to loop through a set of things such as a list of words, the lines in a file, or a list of numbers. When we have a list of things to loop through, we can construct a definite loop using a `for` statement. We call the `while` statement an indefinite loop because it simply loops until some condition becomes `False`, whereas the `for` loop is looping through a known set of items so it runs through as many iterations as there are items in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of a `for` loop is similar to the `while` loop in that there is a `for` statement and a loop body:\n",

    "friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']\n",
    "for friend in friends:\n",
    "    print('Happy New Year:', friend)\n",
    "print('Done!')\n",

    "In this loop we do use the *iteration variable*. Instead of simply adding one to the `count` as in the previous loop, we add the actual number (3, 41, 12, etc.) to the running total during each loop iteration. If you think about the variable `total`, it contains the \"running total of the values so far\". So before the loop starts `total` is zero because we have not yet seen any values, during the loop `total` is the running total, and at the end of the loop `total` is the overall total of all the values in the list.\n",

    "As the loop executes, `total` accumulates the sum of the elements; a variable used this way is sometimes called an **accumulator**.\n",

    "One way to cut your debugging time is \"debugging by bisection.\" For example, if there are 100 lines in your program and you check them one at a time, it would take 100 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, try to break the problem in half. Look at the middle of the program, or near it, for an intermediate value you can check. Add a `print` statement (or something else that has a verifiable effect) and run the program.\n",

    "\n",
    "In practice it is not always clear what the \"middle of the program\" is and not always possible to check it. It doesn't make sense to count lines and find the exact midpoint. Instead, think about places in the program where there might be errors and places where it is easy to put a check. Then choose a spot where you think the chances are about the same that the bug is before or after the check."
